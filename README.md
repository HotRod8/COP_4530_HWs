# COP_4530_HWs

Hello there. These files are my homeworks for COP 4530 (a.k.a Data Structures 2). This link is only meant for interviews.
  - HW1: In here, I'm creating an example of the vector library in C++. Most of my code is templated, so it will work for any data type.
  - HW2: In here, I'm creating an example of the doubly-linked list library in C++.
  - HW3: In here, I'm creating an example of the stack library with a math binary tree in C++.
  - HW4: In here, I'm creating an example of a binary expression tree in C++.
  - HW5: In here, I'm creating an example of a hash table in C++.
