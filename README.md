# COP_4530_HWs

Hello there. These files are my homeworks for COP 4530 (a.k.a Data Structures 2). This link is only meant for interviews.
  - HW1: In here, I'm creating an example of the vector library in C++. Mostly works as intended.
  - HW2: In here, I'm creating an example of the doubly-linked list library in C++. Works exactly as intended.
  - HW4: In here, I'm creating an example of a binary expression tree in C++. Mostly works as intended.
  - HW5: In here, I'm creating an example of a hash table in C++. Mostly works as intended.
